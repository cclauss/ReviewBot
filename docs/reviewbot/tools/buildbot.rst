.. deprecated:: 2.0

Buildbot support is no longer available as of Review Bot 3.0.

The original version of this feature wasn't useful outside of very
limited configurations. We're instead planning to make proper support for
Buildbot available as a formal integration in a future version of Review
Board.

See the other CI options available in Review Board:

* `Circle CI <https://www.reviewboard.org/integrations/circleci/>`_
* `Jenkins <https://www.reviewboard.org/integrations/jenkins/>`_
* `Travis-CI <https://www.reviewboard.org/integrations/travis-ci/>`_
