Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed a crash when using :ref:`Shellcheck <tool-shellcheck>` on Python 3.

* Fixed a bad result when :ref:`PMD <tool-pmd>` reports zero results for a
  file.

* Fixed a crash when viewing the list of installed automated review tools in
  the administration UI in Review Board 5.

* The diff display for comments are now capped to 10 lines.

  This is helpful for tools that may report line ranges for entire functions
  or classes (such as :ref:`PMD <tool-pmd>`).

  When the lines are capped, the original line range is shown in the comment,
  so reviewers can still find all affected lines in the diff viewer.
