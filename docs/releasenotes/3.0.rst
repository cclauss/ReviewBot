Review Bot 3.0 Release Notes
============================

**Release date**: TBD


Compatibility
=============

Review Bot 3.0 includes full support for Review Board 3.0 and 4.0, and
Python 2.7 and 3.6 through 3.9.

We previously stated that Review Bot 2.0 offered support for Review Board 4.0
and Python 3, but due to changes made since that announcement, it's no longer
compatible. If you're planning to move to Review Board 4.0 or Python 3, you'll
want to install Review Bot 3.0.
